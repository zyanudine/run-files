# Linux shell command guide for run MMD pipeline
# I will go through this so you can practice.
# This is for Notch project (GIST will be similar).
# All files related to this are available at \\192.168.90.5\public\Bioinformatics\Linux
****** Please change only the pipeline command file, do not change anything else on the Linux********

Note:  
This run guide use Notch as example (notch.sh) but it is generally applicable to other runs, such as GIST, Notch with ogap.
If there is specific requirement not explained in this file for a run, I will list it in each specific run guide.


1. Check computer
Before running, check Linux computer is running OK, if frozen (cannot login or ssh not working), need to restart the computer. 
For CAM Linux computer: you can press power button to shut down, and then restart computer. 
For PDX computer, ask Ryan for assistance.


2.  Access to Linux
Use the Linux computer in my office, you can ssh to PDX (username zyan, pass: mmmmmm)
or
Install Cygwin on your windows computer, and ssh to CAM and PDX through Cygwin

Follow
http://Cygwin.com/install.html
to download and install Cygwin
I also put Cygwin copy in 
\\192.168.90.5\public\Bioinformatics\Linux
Most computers here are 64_bit, so need to install x64 version
Remember to select and install ssh package

I will show you how to install Cygwin if you are interested, so you can try on your own.


3. ssh to Linux computer
(1) If use Cygwin, you can ssh to Linux computer at both CAM and PDX (if use at home and outside MMD network, you
need to run SonicWall VPN client at same time so you can access MMD computers) 
(2) If use my office Linux computer, you do not need to ssh to CAM, you can ssh to PDX

To ssh:
Open a terminal on my Linux computer or open Cygwin terminal window
to ssh to CAM, type:
ssh zyan@192.168.90.111, then input password: mmmmmm
to ssh to PDX, type:
ssh zyan@192.168.80.24, then input password: mmmmmm

you will be logged into CAM or PDX Linux computer (if not working after multiple tries, computer may be down, need
to check)


4. Run pipeline
Now you are under Linux computer after ssh login (you will see hostname zyan-GA-880GM-USB3 for CAM or 
zyan-ThinkStation-E31 for PDX)
First type:
cdl
to go to working path

Here instead of type pipeline commands one by one, we put all commands in a file (notch.sh, it is already generated), 
so you can run the commands by executing the file. You can also modify the file for each new run.

We have created a folder called “run-files”, and put all original run file (notch.sh) in it.
Type
cd run-files
to go to this folder
then type
cp notch.sh notch-mmd153-date.sh         
to create a new run file with run name and date for new run (for example mmd-153)

Then edit the new file “notch-mmd153-date.sh”, to edit

Type
pico notch-mmd153-date.sh 
to open the notch-mmd153-date.sh file

Modify following:
(1) "project", which is run folder name under TS folder results/analysis/output/Home/
(2) "samples", need to check sample sheet to decide which samples are in each batch
(3) "bar2samplefile", sample sheet file name if it is different
(4) "roi", roi file name if it is different, only previously used ROIs are available, new ROI file need to be added
into pipeline first
(5) "control" if control from other run is used. Change to "control=null" if no control or control is in the same run.
To modify control, change the project name and barcode part of the long string

type
ctrl + O (ou not zero), then enter to save during editing

after finishing editing, type
ctrl + O, then enter to save, ctrl + X  to exit 

open the file again to double check

then type
chmod +x notch-mmd153-date.sh 
to make sure it is executable

if you are sure the file is right, then you need to go back to the working folder
Type
cdl    or   cd ..
to go back to working folder

then
type
nohup ./run-files/notch-mmd153-date.sh &
to execute the file and pipeline

to monitor the running process (for example for MMD-165), type following commands:
project=Auto_user_MMD-165-Notch_PrimerMFR_Val1_167_252
watch -n 2 "tail -20  tmp/$project.nohup"


5. Check files
Wait several hours and check files in windows share folder to see if pipeline is 
finished (do not open file before it finishes).  You need to check
(1) The summary files for the run is generated
(2) File date is right
If the files are all generated, open the file to check content.

6. Rerun and troubleshooting
If something is wrong, repeat above steps and rerun, it may solve the problem.
Or contact me so I can troubleshoot the problem.

7. For GIST project, it will be similar (use gist_pool1_2.sh and gist_pool3.sh file insteal of notch.sh). 
   I will write separate guide if needed.




8. Tips
(1) Instead of change/edit barcode one by one, you can do a command like:
./codes/get_bar.sh Auto_user_MMD-149-Notch_Pilot6_151_232 Notch_AmpliSeq_run_barcode_sample_key_sheet.txt
To get all the barcodes in each pool
Then copy and paste the barcodes

(2) Instead of change string (such as project name) one by one in “pico”, you can
do “ctrl+\” to find and replace

(3) Under Linux, you can copy by select string first, then paste by clicking middle button of mouse (or by type shift+ins)
